# Stock price comparison using Ploylt-Dash

This data visulasition project is simple but complex enough to understand how to use ploylt and dash to build interactive web application. You can interact with the generated visulisation in [this link](https://stock-price-dash.herokuapp.com/).

It shows two different plots. The scatter plot presents historical stock price comparison of three companies, Apple, Amazon and Google. You can choose what price you want to see using the radio buttons above the plot.

The other plot shows the volume of sales in different years. Again, you can choose a year (between 2015 to 2019) to play around.
